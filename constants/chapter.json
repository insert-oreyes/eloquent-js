The chapter also explains how JavaScript is organized and how it differs from other programming languages. Here are the following assignments: 1) Write a loop that makes seven calls to output a triangle. 2)Write a program that print all the numbers from 1 to 100. For numbers divisible by 3, print Fizz, and for numbers 5, print Buzz. 3) Write a program that represents an 8√ó8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines.",
