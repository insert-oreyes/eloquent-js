Website link: <https://eloquent-js.vercel.app/>

## Summary

A mentoring project and website around the eloquent JavaScript book, to be used as portfolio aimed to tech recruiters.

Mentor: [@jportella93](https://github.com/jportella93)

### Purpose

Eloquent JavaScript is a challenging book. At the end of every chapter, there are a few exercises which are usually on the difficult side. Recruiters would value a candidate that, not only has read this book, but also has crafted a website showing what they have learned in collaboration with a more senior engineer, using real world practices.

### Goals

- Practice working in a collaborative project with real world tools and workflows
- Practice mentoring
- Complete a challenging technical book
- Practice coming up with creative ways to show learnings from the book by applying them in a website
- Aim to present the project as portfolio item for all collaborators

## Deliverables

- A responsive website
- A public git repository, hosted on GitHub

### Website

Multi page website with a presentation page and one page per each book chapter. All pages will show navigation and link to the repository.

In the presentation page, information about this project and contact info of authors will be presented to tech recruiters.

In each chapter page, a link to the book chapter will be presented, along with a section for each author where they will resolve the exercise for that chapter. As the challenges of the book aren’t really visual, but more thought to be solved as algorithms, each author will have to use some creativity to demonstrate what they have learned in the chapter.

For example, if the challenge is to show a word in the console such as “hello world”, a creative way to show this would be tapping on a button which shows the words with a fade-in animation.

### Git repository

The public repository for the website is of utmost importance, as it will show tech recruiters the good working practices of the candidate.

All work on this repo will be done using the GitHub workflow, where the remote repository is cloned on each contributor’s computer, and, for each proposed change, the following steps are taken:
A local branch is created off a fresh remote main branch
Changes are done locally in this new branch
When a new change is merged in the remote branch, the local branch is rebased on a fresh copy of remote main branch to keep both branches in sync
When all work is completed in the local branch, it is pushed to the remote repository and a pull request to the main remote branch is created
Once the pull request is approved by the other author, the branch is merged to the main branch, squashing all the commits into a single commit

## Tooling

Using industry-standard technologies and tools is instrumental for the purpose of this project.

For the website, the following code libraries and frameworks will be used:

- React.js via the Next.js meta-framework
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling

For collaboration, the following tools will be used

- Slack for communication
- GitHub for code collaboration
- Jira for project management
